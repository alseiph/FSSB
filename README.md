This repository is designed for sharing the supplementary movies for the manuscript entitled: 'Formation of stable aggregates by fluid-assembled solid bridges', by Seiphoori et al. (2019).
# Movie S1
The movie shows a deposit formed by evaporation from a suspension of polydisperse silica spheres composed of 20, 3, and 0.4-µm particles, subject to rewetting and transport in a microfluidic channel.
# Movie S2 
The movie shows an evaporating suspension of bidisperse silica spheres composed of 20 and 3-µm particles on a silicate coverslip substrate. The retreating air-water interface drags 3-µm particles and condenses some of them within the meniscus formed between the 20-µm particles and the substrate or between adjacent particles. After water is fully evaporated, small particles form ‘solid bridges’ that connect larger particles to the substrate and to each other to make aggregates.
# Movie S3 
The movie shows aggregates formed by evaporation from a suspension of bidisperse silica spheres composed of 20, and 3-µm particles subject to rewetting. The 20-µm particles that are stabilized through solid bridging are not transported by the flow. 
# Movie S4 
The movie shows a deposit formed by evaporation from a monodisperse suspension of 20-µm particles subject to rewetting, where particles are easily transported due to the absence of solid bridges. 
# Movie S5 
The movie shows aggregates formed by evaporation from a suspension of unsieved, polydisperse illite clay particles subject to rewetting. Aggregates are stable due to solid bridges. 
# Movie S6
The movie shows aggregates of illite clay modified by sieving out particles < 5 µm subject to rewetting, and transport of particles due to the absence of small particles and the associated solid bridges.
 # Movie S7 
The movie shows the rewetting behavior of aggregates formed by evaporation from a suspension of unsieved, polydisperse kaolinite clay particles. Aggregates are stable due to solid bridges. 
# Movie S8 
The movie shows aggregates of same kaolinite clay modified by sieving out particles < 5 µm subject to rewetting. Most aggregates are unstable due to the absence of solid bridges. 
# Movie S9
The movie shows water condensation on surfaces of both the substrate and silica particles during rewetting in a microfluidic channel. Hydration due to humidity precedes the wetting front and could weaken inter-particle bonds due to development of interfacial (repulsive) forces.  
# Movie S10
The movie shows water condensation on surfaces of kaolinite clay particles during rewetting in a microfluidic channel.
